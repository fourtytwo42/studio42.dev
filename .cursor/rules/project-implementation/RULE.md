# Project Implementation Guide

**CRITICAL:** When a user asks you to build or implement a project, you MUST first locate and read the project documentation. The documentation contains all specifications, technologies, patterns, and decisions needed to build the project correctly.

## Finding Project Documentation

### Step 1: Identify the Project

**When user says:**
- "Build [project name]"
- "Implement [project name]"
- "Start working on [project name]"
- "Create [project name]"

**Action:** Identify the project name and search for its documentation.

### Step 2: Locate Documentation

**Search Methods:**

**Method 1: Search by Project Name**
```bash
# Search for project files
codebase_search("Where is the [project name] project documented?", ["brain/projects"])
```

**Method 2: Check PROJECTS_INDEX.md**
- Read `brain/projects/_meta/PROJECTS_INDEX.md`
- Find project by name or category
- Follow link to project documentation

**Method 3: Browse by Year**
- If you know the year, check `brain/projects/YYYY/` folders
- Look for folder matching project name (kebab-case)

**Method 4: Search All Project Files**
```bash
# Use grep to find project mentions
rg -i "project-name" brain/projects/
```

### Step 3: Read Main Project File

**Always start with the main project file:**
- Path: `brain/projects/YYYY/project-name/project-name.md`
- This is the navigation hub with links to all artifacts

**What to Read:**
1. **Concept** - Understand what the project does
2. **Core Architecture** - High-level system design
3. **Status** - Current phase, what's done, what's next
4. **Project Artifacts** - Links to detailed documentation

### Step 4: Read Relevant Artifacts

**Based on what you're building, read:**
- **Architecture artifact** - If building components or understanding system
- **API artifact** - If building API endpoints
- **Smart Contract artifact** - If building smart contracts
- **Implementation artifact** - If setting up development environment
- **Security artifact** - If implementing security features

**Reading Order:**
1. Main project file (overview)
2. Architecture artifact (system design)
3. Implementation artifact (setup, patterns, structure)
4. Specific artifacts as needed (API, contracts, etc.)

## Understanding Project Documentation

### Key Information to Extract

**1. Technology Stack**
- **Exact versions:** Note exact versions specified (e.g., "React 18.2.0", not just "React")
- **Why chosen:** Understand reasoning for technology choices
- **Dependencies:** Note all dependencies and their versions

**2. Architecture & Design**
- **Component structure:** How components are organized
- **Data flow:** How data moves through the system
- **Patterns:** What architectural patterns are used
- **Interactions:** How components interact

**3. Implementation Details**

- **Database schema:** Exact field types, constraints, indexes
- **Smart contracts:** Exact function signatures, events, state
- **Data structures:** Exact formats and validation rules

**5. Decisions Made**
- **Why decisions were made:** Understand reasoning
- **Trade-offs:** What was gained/lost with decisions
- **Alternatives considered:** What other options were evaluated

### What to Look For

## Using Project Documentation When Building

### Before Starting

**1. Verify You Have All Information**
- [ ] Technology stack with exact versions
- [ ] Project structure defined
- [ ] Setup steps documented
- [ ] Patterns and conventions specified
- [ ] All specifications needed for your task

**2. Check Current Status**
- What's already built?
- What's in progress?
- What should you work on next?
- Are there any blockers?

**3. Understand the Context**
- What phase is the project in? (planning, design, development, testing)
- What's the priority?
- What are the constraints?

### During Implementation

**1. Follow Exact Specifications**
- **Use exact versions:** Don't use different versions than specified
- **Follow structure:** Use the exact project structure documented
- **Follow patterns:** Use the coding patterns and conventions specified
- **Follow formats:** Use exact API formats, data structures, etc.

**2. Reference Documentation Frequently**
- Check documentation when unsure
- Verify your implementation matches specifications
- Ensure you're following patterns correctly

**3. Document What You Build**
- Update status in main project file
- Add notes about implementation details
- Document any deviations and why

**4. Ask Questions If Needed**
- If documentation is unclear or missing information
- If you encounter issues not covered in docs
- If you need to make decisions not documented

### Implementation Checklist

**Before Writing Code:**
- [ ] Read main project file
- [ ] Read relevant artifacts
- [ ] Understand architecture
- [ ] Understand patterns and conventions
- [ ] Verify setup is correct

**While Writing Code:**
- [ ] Follow exact project structure
- [ ] Use exact technology versions
- [ ] Follow coding patterns specified
- [ ] Match API/data format specifications

3. Is it in the main project file?

**If Still Missing:**
- Ask the user for clarification
- Don't guess or assume
- Document what's missing in your response

### If Information is Unclear

**Actions:**
1. Re-read the relevant section
2. Check related artifacts
3. Look for examples or additional context
4. Ask the user for clarification

**Don't:**
- Make assumptions
- Use different versions/patterns than specified
- Skip unclear parts

### If Specifications Conflict

**Actions:**
1. Check if there's a "Decisions Made" section explaining the conflict
2. Check if one specification is more recent
3. Ask the user which specification to follow

## Best Practices

### 1. Read First, Code Second
- Always read documentation before writing code
- Understand the full context before implementing
- Don't start coding until you understand the specifications

### 2. Follow Exactly
- Use exact versions specified
- Follow exact structure documented
- Match exact formats specified
- Don't deviate without good reason

### 3. Verify Frequently
- Check your implementation against specifications
- Ensure you're following patterns correctly
- Verify versions and configurations match

### 4. Document Changes
- If you need to deviate, document why
- Update project status as you work
- Add notes about implementation details

### 5. Ask When Needed
- Ask if documentation is unclear
- Ask if information is missing
- Ask if you need to make decisions not documented

## Example Workflow

```
User: "Build the user authentication feature for the marketplace project"

AI Assistant Process:
1. Search for marketplace project: codebase_search("marketplace project documentation", ["brain/projects"])
2. Find: brain/projects/2025/decentralized-marketplace/decentralized-marketplace-platform.md
3. Read main file:
   - Understand: It's a decentralized marketplace
   - Status: In development, authentication not yet implemented
   - Architecture: Uses smart contracts, IPFS, encrypted messaging
4. Read architecture artifact:
   - Understand: Wallet-based authentication (MetaMask)
   - No traditional username/password
5. Read API artifact:
   - Check if there are auth endpoints (none yet - need to implement)
6. Read implementation artifact:
   - Project structure: frontend/, backend/, contracts/
   - Patterns: TypeScript, Next.js, Solidity
7. Implement:
   - Follow exact structure
   - Use wallet integration pattern
   - Follow coding conventions
8. Update status in main project file
```
